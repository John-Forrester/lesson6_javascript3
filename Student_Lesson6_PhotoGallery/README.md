### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (One thing I learned about in this assignment is the DOM or Document Object Model. This structure allows for interconnectedness between certain classes and variables within an HTML model for easier manipulation of data and representation.)
2. (Another thing I learned about is the BOM or Browser Object Model. This model is more loose in regards to rules and regulations unlike the DOM. The browser object model is nearly identical amongst other browsers and therefore can be used in any way desired by the one manipulating it.)
3. (Finally, I learned how to implement the DOM into a webpage and modify it's contents with solely a javascript file.)
